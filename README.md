<h2 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael</h2>

I am a driven Data Science and Analytics Masters student at the University of Calgary. Previously, I studied and researched chemistry at the University of Alberta. I love learning from data and am always open to collaborating on projects with new people. Communication and work ethic are my strengths, and I am motivated to achieve collective goals and make meaningful progress. Outside of data science, I enjoy checking out local restaurants, working out, and watching football (go Seahawks!). On my page, you can find my current and past work, which showcase team projects (and individual projects coming soon) that I've worked on in my data science journey.

### Master's Projects


<details>
<summary><h4>Data 604 - SQL_Queries</h4></summary> 
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td width= "60%">
      The main focus of data 604 was utilizing SQl through mySQL and SQL Alchemy to effectively navigate and explore databases. My team and I looked into on Alberta air quality and what factors may be directly related to specific air quality levels seen in Alberta. We leveraged open source datasets from the Government of Alberta on factors including demographics, agriculture, greenhouse gas emissions, and life expectancy to create a database and find insights through SQL queries.

<summary><h4>Data 603 - MLR_Car_Emissions</h4></summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width= "60%">
      The two core learning objectives in data 603 were multiple linear regression and logistical regression. I learned how to utilize these two regression methods in R studio using R. My team and I conducted a project on car CO2 emissions, looking to model which components in cars determine their level of CO2 output. Within this project, we created a multiple linear regression model that could account for 99.81% of adjusted variance in car CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the model did not pass assumption tests for equal variance and normality, but it was a good learning experience for understanding the workflow to make a regression model.

<summary><h4>Data 602 - Horror_Movie_Ratings</h4></summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width= "60%">
      In data 602, we reviewed and practiced fundamental statistics in R using R studio. The main concepts were covered involved probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, bootstrapping, central limit theorem, and linear regression.

<summary><h4>Data 601 - Food_Affordability_Analysis</h4></summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width= "60%">
      Data 601 was my main introductory course in data science in python, and we were taught how to take advantage of a variety of different libraries for data wrangling and analysis (NumPy, pandas, matplotlibs, plotly, etc.). My team and I completed a comprhensive analysis of Canadian food affordability for our class project by utilizing data on Canadian food security levels, food prices, and food spending habits. We cleaned and merged multiple datasets using pandas, completed statistical analysis on the data, and leveraged our free student subscription to tableau to create clear and comprehensive visualizations. All of our findings are put together in a 42 page final report in my repository.
